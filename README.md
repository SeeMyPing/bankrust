### Brankrupt

The idea of this project is to learn Rust by creating a simple banking app.
The app is supposed to have accounts and transaction. Based on transactions you calculate the balance of each account.
More features will be added by the time i'm learning this shit. Well, it's not shit but it's hard for me to go back into this kind of language, so please be indulgent.
